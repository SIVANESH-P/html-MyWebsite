            This is one of my favorite sci-fi movie by Christopher Nolan. Lot of interesting scientific theories and facts are represented visually in this movie.
            This movie definitely blows yours mind in your first watch and you understand the movie in your second watch. I do recommend watching this movie many times and I believe you don't get bored.
